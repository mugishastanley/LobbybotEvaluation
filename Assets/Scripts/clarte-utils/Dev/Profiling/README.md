Profiling
===============
Contents:
- Profiler: profiling probe. Allows to define profiling probes (measuring code execution time between 2 points) and display the average duration.
- LogInFile: simple logging class mainly designed for dumping measurements into an excel-compatible format (without all the unity blah blah).
- Chrono: chronometer class. Always useful.
